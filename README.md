# JnanaMandal 🔶

**JnanaMandal** — “Circle of Knowledge” — is my personal knowledge hub, a curated universe of ideas, experiments, and projects across multiple technologies. Think of it as a living repository where concepts meet code, and learning transforms into action.  

Here, I share my journey of solving real-world problems and building scalable systems.
